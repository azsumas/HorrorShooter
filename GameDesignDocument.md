### Elevator Pitch.
First person shooter survival horror full of dark path and squeaky noises, a few bullets, a battered armor and robotic monsters waiting in the darkness.

## Project Description. 
### Context, Scenario and Objectives of the game.
You are a soldier and you team has been send to a robotic laboratory to stop a robotic rebellion that could be dangerous if it scapes. But you lose your team in an accident and now you are alone. Your armor is damaged but you make it work again. The AI of the armor reconnects and tells you that you already have some functions like the radar, your localization, some armor energy, a torch and a functional weapon.  From there you must move along and scape.
Throw the path you will find some of the rebel robots and they will try to kill you, so you must be cautious and think very well which path will you take. 

### Gameplay commentary based on the AGE framework.
The main emotion that the player will feel is the fear, that causes a survival instinct. The player could feel tempted to explore, but  the more he explores more dangerous can be the path, and higher can be the reward.

### Types of decisions. 
The player has total freedom of move, although the global path is linear. 
There aren’t social decisions. 
There are exchanges of resources, energy for light and survival capacity. 
Risk vs Rewards. The player can find optional paths and rooms where he can find enemies, resources or nothing. The decision is based on taking the risk of getting new resources but having to fight or even die, or simply keep moving alone. 

### What makes our game unique? 
- Futuristic and dark ambience.
- Half organic enemies half robots.
- Action and fear alike.
- Integrated HUD in the world.
