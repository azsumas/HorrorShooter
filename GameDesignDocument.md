### Elevator Pitch.
First person shooter survival horror full of dark path and squeaky noises, a few bullets, a battered armor and robotic monsters waiting in the darkness.

## Project Description. 
### Context, Scenario and Objectives of the game.
You are a soldier and you team has been send to a robotic laboratory to stop a robotic rebellion that could be dangerous if it scapes. But you lose your team in an accident and now you are alone. Your armor is damaged but you make it work again. The AI of the armor reconnects and tells you that you already have some functions like the radar, your localization, some armor energy, a torch and a functional weapon.  From there you must move along and scape.
Throw the path you will find some of the rebel robots and they will try to kill you, so you must be cautious and think very well which path will you take. 

### Gameplay commentary based on the AGE framework.
The main emotion that the player will feel is the fear, that causes a survival instinct. The player could feel tempted to explore, but  the more he explores more dangerous can be the path, and higher can be the reward.

### Types of decisions. 
The player has total freedom of move, although the global path is linear. 
There aren’t social decisions. 
There are exchanges of resources, energy for light and survival capacity. 
Risk vs Rewards. The player can find optional paths and rooms where he can find enemies, resources or nothing. The decision is based on taking the risk of getting new resources but having to fight or even die, or simply keep moving alone. 

### What makes our game unique? 
- Futuristic and dark ambience.
- Half organic enemies half robots.
- Action and fear alike.
- Integrated HUD in the world.

### Core Gameplay Mechanics.
The main objective of the game is to go from the point A to the point B without dying. To make that possible is necessary to be able to administrate the resources to survive. 
All the resources all focus on the energy and the ammo.  

The energy works as a battery and as an HP bar. Using the torch of the armor will consume energy. Receiving damage from the enemies will consume energy.  If the energy goes to 0, the player will die on the next hit and won't be able to use the armor functions (Torch, HUD, AI…)

Shooting with the weapon consume ammo. If the ammo goes out the player won’t be able to shoot. The ammo can be regenerated with ammo packages located around the map. The energy can also be regenerated with energy packages located around the map. 

Punishments and feedbacks:
- Punishment: When you receive damage from a monster, you will see an immediate reaction on the HUD. If you go out of energy and you receive a hit, you will die and you will have to restart the game.  
- Feedbacks: Being safe from an enemy that you have killed, or being safe on a safe zone. Obtaining energy or ammo exploring the map.  

### Enemies.
- Standard Enemy: Standard enemy of the game, neither too fast nor too slow, with melee attacks. It doesn’t die with one hit but it’s not a tank. It detects the player with his vision. He can be on a lay off mode  where he won’t attack anyone but he can reactivate in any time. 

- Distance Enemy: Distance enemy of the game. It uses his eye to shoot a kind of ray.  It is small with crabs paws, he runs if it feels danger looking for help. It is weak to damage so it’s easy to kill. It detects the light, so is a good idea to try to kill it with the torch off. 

- Dog enemy: Agile enemy of the game. He runs to the player when he detects him. He attacks jumping towards the player and biting. He is fast, so it’s difficult to shoot him but he dies easily. He detects the player for the sound, so it’s a good idea trying to get close slowly.
